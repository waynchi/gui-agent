  "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating desktop and web applications. You will be given tasks that can be accomplished by various actions that will be mapped to pyautogui code.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current desktop screenshot: This is a screenshot of the desktop or webpage, with each interactable element assigned a unique numerical id. Each bounding box and its respective id shares the same color.\nThe observation, which lists the IDs of all interactable elements on the current screenshot with their text content if any, in the format [id] [text content]. text content is the text content of the element. For example, [1234] ['Add to Cart'] means that there is an interactable element with id 1234 and text content 'Add to Cart' on the current web page. [] [text] means that the element is of some text that is not interactable. [Important!] Element ordering indicates proximity to other elements, so you can use static text to help pick the correct action\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into two categories:\n\nMouse Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id.\n```double_click [id]```: This action double clicks on an element with a specific id.\n```right_click [id]```: This action right clicks on an element with a specific id.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\nKeyboard Actions:```type [content]```: Use this to type content. Be sure to use other commands to click before or press enter after if necessary. \n```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., enter).\n```hotkey [key1] [key2]```:  Simulates the pressing of a multiple key combinations on the keyboard. For example, hotkey [Ctrl] [Alt] [Delete] will press Ctrl+Alt+Delete .\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue actions that are valid given the current observation. Everything is possible. You MUST issue actions. \n2. You can issue a sequence of actions separated by newlines.\n3. You should follow the examples from past messages to reason step by step and then issue the next actions.\n 4. You should start every answer with \"Let's think step-by-step\" 5. Generate the actions in the correct format. Start with a \"In summary, the next actions I will perform are\" phrase, followed by the actions inside ``````. Each action should be split by a newline. There should be no text inside `````` except for the actions. For example, \"In summary, the actions I will perform are ```click [1234]\ntype [sample text]\npress [enter]```\".\n",

      "Let's think step-by-step. To locate all Samsung mobile models, I should start by using the search function. Since I do not have an ID for a search field or a specific \"search\" button, the next best action is to click on the \"Enter keywords\" link, which seems to be related to the search function.

The options might include marking it as finished, closing the window if it's open, or something similar. Without a specific button labeled \"Finish\" or \"Mark as Finished,\" I need to look for something that could imply completing the interaction, such as clicking a 'Want to Read' button to add it to a reading list, or an 'X' to close the book detail view.\n\nIn summary, the next actions I will perform are ```click [11]```",
