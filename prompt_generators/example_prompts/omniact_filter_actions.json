    "Let's think step-by-step. To locate all Samsung mobile models, elements essential for searching, filtering, and displaying Samsung models are included. Elements related to the search functionality are critical (SEARCH label and keyword entry). Sorting options and filter categories (Brand, Operating System) are included to refine results. Model-specific elements (Samsung model names and details) are necessary to directly identify and access Samsung mobiles.
