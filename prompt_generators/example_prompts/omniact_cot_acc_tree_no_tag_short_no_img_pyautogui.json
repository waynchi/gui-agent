  "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating desktop and web applications. You will be given a task that needs a pyautogui script to complete.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe observation, which lists the IDs of all interactable elements on the current screenshot with their text content if any, in the format [id] [x:x_coord,y:y_coord] [text content]. text content is the text content of the element. For example, [1234] [x:50, y:100] ['Add to Cart'] means that there is an interactable element with id 1234 and text content 'Add to Cart' on the current web page at coordinates x=50, y=100. x_coord and y_coord are the x and y pixel coordinates of the element. [] [x:x_coords, y:y_coords] [text] means that the element is of some text that is not interactable. [Important!] Element ordering indicates proximity to other elements, so you can use static text to help pick the correct action\n\nHere is the API Reference for pyautogui: def click(x: float, y: float):\n    \"\"\"Takes the mouse to location (x, y) and performs a left click.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef doubleClick(x: float, y: float):\n    \"\"\"Moves the mouse to location (x, y) and performs a double left click.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef rightClick(x: float, y: float):\n    \"\"\"Moves the mouse to location (x, y) and performs a right click.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef moveTo(x: float, y: float, duration: float = 0):\n    \"\"\"Moves the mouse to a new location (x, y) over 'duration' seconds.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef dragTo(x: float, y: float, duration: float = 0, button: str = 'left'):\n    \"\"\"Drags the mouse to a new location (x, y) over 'duration' seconds while holding down 'button'.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef scroll(clicks: int):\n    \"\"\"Scrolls the mouse 'clicks' amount where positive numbers scroll up and negative numbers scroll down.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef hscroll(clicks: int):\n    \"\"\"Horizontally scrolls the mouse 'clicks' amount where positive numbers scroll right and negative numbers scroll left.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef press(key: str):\n    \"\"\"Simulates the press of a single keyboard 'key'.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef hotkey(*keys: str):\n    \"\"\"Simulates pressing multiple keyboard keys at once in the order they are given.\"\"\"\n    pass\ndef write(text: str):\n    \"\"\"Types the given 'text' as if it were being typed on a keyboard.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only output a pyautogui script that is valid given the current observation. Everything is possible with one script. You MUST output a script. \n2. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then write out the pyautogui script.\n3. You should start every answer with \"Let's think step-by-step\"4. Generate the pyautogui script in the correct format. Start with a \"In summary, the pyautogui script is\" phrase, followed by the pyautogui script inside ``````. Each action should be split by a newline. There should be no text inside `````` except for the pyautogui script. For example, \"In summary, the pyautogui script is```pyautogui.click(100, 200)\npyautogui.write(\"sample text\")\npyautogui.press(\"enter\")```\".",

      "Let's think step-by-step. To locate all Samsung mobile models, I should start by using the search function. Since I do not have an ID for a search field or a specific \"search\" button, the next best action is to click on the \"Enter keywords\" link, which seems to be related to the search function. After clicking, I would then type \"Samsung\" into the search field to filter the products.\n\nIn summary, the pyautogui script is ```pyautogui.click(642.0,855.0)\npyautogui.type(\"Samsung\")\npyautogui.press(\"enter\")```",
